        <p class="lead mb-4"> <br><br>Elise Wyman went to high school in Davis, California. Then she moved onto Harvard for her undergraduate degree in astrophysics. She graduated in 2008 at the top of her class. After Harvard, she decided that she wanted to move onto something that she was passionate about and entered into clown school at Chuckles University. She spent seven years at Chuckles and made many close friends there. After, Wyman decided to work in the White House as the professional House and Senate clown.
          From her work within the White House, Wyman was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. After retiring from her work there, Wyman decided that she wanted to settle down in the small town of New York City. Wyman soon got tired of her time in retirement, and she had a dream one night that she started a successful business administration company in money laundering.
          With the help of her friends at the White House, she depleted funds from the stock market, and successfully dispensed them to the Illuminati to fund Beyonce's singing career. Sending out subliminal messages in the Lemonade music video helped her feel fulfilled within her life.
          She decided to further her subliminal messaging career within the Nickelodeon community. She worked on projects like Spongebob Squarepants, Victorious, and Fairly Odd Parents.
          After many years of this, she missed her days in the clowning community and chose to return to England to jest for the queen of England. When Wyman presented her with her ceremonial sword, she accidentally stabbed Her Highness.
